# Reflections

I've created this section partly out of a desire I've had since starting therapy in my childhood, and partly inspired by Marcus Aurelius' Meditations.

For a long time now, I've considered documenting my internal conversations as a way to reinforce philosophical principles, track my mindset, and guide its growth toward a desired state.

Personally, I believe that a path to "happiness" lies primarily in acceptance of nature's way, or simply how things truly are. In Stoic philosophy, as mentioned in Meditations, this concept is referred to as "logos" (or logic). According to this idea, if something has happened, it logically follows that it should have happened and is thus inherently correct. The philosophy also suggests that our perceptions of events as "lucky," "unlucky," "sad," or "happy" are merely subjective interpretations. These perceptions are distinct from "logos," meaning events themselves are correct despite how we perceive them.

In this regard, I've found a connection with Meditations. Additionally, Marcus Aurelius appears to have written Meditations as a means of reinforcing and applying his personal philosophy, one that, interestingly, doesn't completely align with traditional Stoicism.

Inspired by this, I've decided to act on my own longstanding desire and follow Marcus Aurelius' example by conducting internal dialogues to reinforce my personal philosophy. Previously, I've drifted away from engaging with my own thoughts and having sincere conversations with myself due to a lack of habit. My aim now is to build this habit through recording my thoughts for future reference, consistently assessing my philosophical perspective as I encounter different situations, and maintaining sincerity with myself. Hopefully, this will be enough to ensure that I continue to work towards fulfilling meaningful goals in ways that bring me joy (i.e. ways that align with my beliefs, dreams, hopes, and principles).

I hope that within these reflections, you might find something beneficial for your own life. All the thoughts and feelings shared here are intentionally presented broadly enough for you to relate to, even if you might disagree with some points.

Thank you for visiting, and enjoy the read!
