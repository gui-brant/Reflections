Sometimes, the concept of commitment can get in the way of things.

For a long time now, I realized in my past couple of therapy sessions, I have been struggling with committing to tasks. Don't get me wrong, it's not like I have trouble performing when I was expected to perform. Whenever I had to write an exam or test, I would work my hardest to do well. Whenever I would start a hobby, I would devote myself to learn it. However, I feel like I have avoided committing my life to something for sheer fear of committing to the wrong thing. 

My brother, for instance, has always been the person to not think hard about these things. My parents would often criticize him on this since he was reckless and would come by more trouble than he needed. I, on the other hand, was always quoted as the cautious kid, who would think before I acted. To some extend, I let that get to me. It got to me enough that I still feel its presence and weight around my actions. For instance, I have run away from many things that I enjoyed doing, simply because I was told that those things were not right or profitable. I would tell myself that I didn't like computers or that I didn't enjoy cooking, even though I had never tried programming a script or preparing a proper dish. The truth was that I would rather hide from the possibility of finding something that I was talented in, for talent could quickly draw commitment in, and if I were to commit to an activity, then I would not be able to commit to anything else. But what if that field didn't make me money? What if I would disappoint my parents? What if I would become that child that "would think before he did things"? What if the talent led me away from some ideal world where I would work with something else that I was talented in and that could "make a global change" or "be the best/richest/most powerful"?

It took me a very long time to realize the flaws in that mindset. I still have not fully left it behind me. But it is evident that one can work with essentially anything and make major changes to countless lives. The x-factor is not what you do, but who you are and what intention you put into your work. You can cook and change people's perspective of things through food, or related products. You can also be a chemical engineer and only create destructive technology for money and status. I faked my way into engineering believing that it would make me the the best version of myself; that it would give me the answers to the questions: what should I commit to? What one thing will allow me to have the largest impact? What is that that I want so desperately, yet can't quite point to? 

We can really only hope to enjoy our lives with the things that we are given. I now find myself in a spot where I can do both: work with something that I enjoy and naturally calls to me (video games) and create something with the potential to have a global impact. But I could have done this without having wasted so much time. I have always had all the resources that I needed and I have had a passion for games for a long time now. Why didn't I look at the obvious years ago? 

Either way, there is no point in crying about spilled milk. That is not the point of this log. The point is that sometimes you can be afraid to commit to a task or a career because you are afraid to admit to yourself that this is what you want, and it is what will succussed. Even after taking all the steps to commit, like joining a university degree or starting a business, one can still be afraid to follow through with it all. This paralyzing apprehension and dread comes from an insecurity to fail and to start something that may not be what you expected. In other words, the fear of committing to a task without any guarantees of success. Unfortunately, though, the more you commit, the more likely you are to succussed. If you don't commit, you are not likely to succussed in any relevant task (particularly those that change things). Relevant tasks always have uncertainty and risk, regardless of your commitment. So, if you don't commit, it won't get done, but if you commit, you won't get to do other things and you have to own up to the risks. 

In a nutshell, if you really want to "changes things for the better": 1. figure out what you want (and, no, wanting something doesn't mean you'll get it... this is no guarantee), 2. figure out what you like (if you hate what you do, it could be exactly what you think you want, but, let's be honest, it's just not), and 3. commit, and work everyday and every hour to get there (every fiber of your body has to go into it). Everything will have risk, especially if you wanna change the way of things. Nothing will be certain or guaranteed. Victory will never stroll to you and sit on your lap like a friendly puppy. Victory will have to be seized, conquered, and taken by force. If you're not willing to commit to the reality and to the risks, then you're also not willing to change. 

If you want it, if you like it, and if those feelings are strong enough that you're willing to give up EVERYTHING for it, then do not think twice about it. Do it. Commit. Hunt it like if your life depended on it, because it likely does... at least essence of who you are does, and that might as well be your life.
