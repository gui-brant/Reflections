Once you have committed to an action, you're the last person in the world that should not believe in the project or the play. 

Today, your professor questioned whether the project could work. He also questioned how you would get funding for it. You replied, politically, with "I'll figure out that problem whenever it comes," but that was not a truthful answer. Not being able to answer that question did not make you feel good. In fact, it made you feel like you didn't trust the project. It made you want to give up a little. You can't give in so easily. To give margin for self-doubt or insecurity after the fact is a major flaw. That is the type of behavior that creates losers. 

If the project is your dream, if it is what you want to do, and if you've already committed heart and soul to it (or to any play for that matter), then you have to be the last lunatic in he universe to even fathom the idea of loss. You have to know, at all moments, that you will thrive and overcome the challenge, regardless of your perceived odds. The only way that DRX could have beaten T1 was by believing that they could have in the first place with every play, in every second of every match before and after. Everything pertaining to technical details, like "how to get funding" or "how will you make that work" will just be that: a technical detail. 

If you have committed, then commit. Have no doubt, have no insecurity, waste no time or effort measuring out the size of the mountain that you will climb. Simply climb the mountain, one step at a time, not looking back and not giving any attention to those that sit at the base watching as you move upwards. Simply look at the next ledge, think of how to move up, and execute. Everything else must me meaningless if you wish to reach the top. If you have committed to the journey fully and intend to be victorious, then insecurities and doubts will only add to the challenge. Leave that extra weight at the base of the mountain. You do not need. You must not have it.
