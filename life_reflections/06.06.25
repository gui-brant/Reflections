Today, I have been presented with a flaw of the ego, and left to ponder on some choices. I've been working on this programming course, specifically on ones of its modules where I have to create a game. Two things became clear in this process: 1. I have a lot of trouble managing my anxiety, and creates a loop that decreases my productivity and 2. I feel inferior when I am given a challenge that I don't wish to complete.

Let's dive more into each individual point:

1. What performance anxiety brings, why it happens, and how to deal with it:

I was taking a long time to finish some of the modules. Moreover, the instructions on the modules were not clear enough that I could simply reread them and figure out what went wrong. In other words, I had to think for myself, given an environment that I wasn't very familiar with. This is not an unfamiliar situation, neither is the anxiety that comes from it. Due to my desire to finish the task in timely manner, I started to get anxious, which led to stress. The stress, as it built up, led to the creation of excuses so that I could start taking shortcuts on the solution process. At this point, I've done enough math and science to know that if you're unsure of how to solve a problem, that means that you lack the fundamental knowledge required to understand it. In that sense, the most efficient path is always to break the problem down to its individual parts, figure out specifically what is getting you confused, look up the concept, understand it, and reattempt the problem. This will not only allow you to learn something new, but will also solve the problem in the shortest time possible. Usually when you try to take shortcuts, if the first few attempts don't work, it becomes a game of guess-and-check, which makes you take more time to solve the problem leading to more stress. Therefore, solutions are always knowledge checks. If you don't have the knowledge, then you can't solve the problem. The cases where the shortcut is more efficient are rare and likely to offset other problems later on. 

Nonetheless, I chose to take the shortcuts today despite knowing this, despite having tried the shortcut in countless other problems and facing the same complications. Why? Anxiety. As I progress through the modules, I would look down on my watch and see that a lot of time had passed. The feeling that I would not have time to do all the other things that I wanted to do kept growing, leading to an artificial feeling of imminent despair. For this reason, I decided to take inefficient paths, either leading to a larger waste of time or a lack of learning (which defeats the whole point of the module). The worst part is that I was aware of how much more time I was wasting by doing so, leading to a growing stress. In other words, I would feel like the task was taking too long, so I grew anxious, leading me to take shortcuts. The shortcuts did not solve my problem fast, so I got even more anxious and stressed (not to mention that I missed a genuine opportunity to learn). The growing stress and anxiety made me lose focus, which made it even harder to tackle tasks and modules efficiently, leading to the desire to take even more shortcuts. It's pretty obvious to see that this is a vicious cycle that 1. takes my ability and opportunity to learn away, 2. stresses me out (a.k.a gets me pissed off), 3. makes me anxious. Needless to say, I don't love the person that I am when this is happening. It's not efficient in any sense, other than achieving high stress/anxiety levels. 

So... how should you break the cycle? There are two ways: you either stop doing what you're doing; or take a short break from it, acknowledge what's going on, and let the feeling go so you can focus on the task. The former method is simple, really. Admit to yourself that you're "tilted," as gamers would call it, and go do something else. Whatever is it that you feel like you should be doing at the moment, go do it and then come back to the task. The latter option is a bit more complicated. It's not always that you'll be able to acknowledge the feeling so that you can let it go, but the more you try, the better you get at it. It does take a lot of practice, though, and wisdom. Unfortunately, however, this is the only sustainable way of dealing with this feeling, as it is not always that you'll be given the chance to just stop a task (you could be on an exam or interview). 

Remember, if you feel stressed or anxious: take a break, breath in, relax for a second, and ask yourself "why am I doing this?" If you feel like you should be doing something else, then go do it. If you feel like that is the right thing to be doing now, then collect yourself and acknowledge that fact that there is no sense in cherishing such an awful feeling, then you get back to doing the work correctly.

2. Why do you feel inferior at avoiding harder tasks than the ones you need to be facing? 

Let's study this instance for a little bit. I looked through the very last slide of the module. Every now and then, I'll peak ahead to get a grasp at the trajectory of a certain module. The module that I'm working on is about recreating the game "Asteroids." The module boils it down to the basics of the game, and leaves a lot of the minor details out (like asteroid explosion VFX). Then, it suggests you to complete these details on your own at the end of the module. It's totally optional, yet I felt terrible after reading it. I was in the anxiety/stress loophole, feeling like there was no hope for me in programming anymore for taking as long as I did to complete fairly simple tasks (irrational thought), when I read these suggestions. Then, I proceeded to think "oh, there is no way I can accomplish that... after all who needs to even accomplish it, it's just a waste of time anyway to try to implement those many things in a little game that nobody will every play but me." After that, my felt blame and ashamed: "how do I aspire to venture myself into the frontiers of AI and probabilistic programming if I won't even propose such a simple task (in the grand scheme of things) upon myself? How will I improve to code really complicated scripts if I won't even do that?" Then, I gave myself excuses: "Imagine if I can't complete this task. I will be exposed. I will prove to myself that I'm terrible at programming and that I will never become good enough to achieve that I wish to achieve. I should just give up on trying this suggestion altogether. Even if I do complete it, taking long to complete it shows that I have no talent and I will never become so great without talent..." 

The thoughts are very irrational, harmful, and toxic. Every skill is built. Even the most talented people require hard work to make their talents useful. Even then, those people make mistakes (sometimes, even really ugly ones). There is nothing wrong with taking your time to learn a new skill and failing while trying. That's just part of the learning process. However, giving up is not so good as failing. If you don't ever try, then you never give yourself the opportunity to test your strength and, consequently, learn more about something. Trying makes you strong, giving up just keeps you where you are currently. Don't get me wrong: giving up is not inherently "bad." I feel like most people condemn the act as if it were some mortal sin. It's really not. Sometimes you put expectations on something and realize that it's not what you expected. Then, giving up is simply a way for you to rendezvous with you own thoughts and come up with some new idea about what you truly want to do. However, that was most certainly not the case here. I just wanted to run away from a test, something that could show me that I still have lots to learn. That's not fruitful if I'm committed to becoming anything, not just a programmer! It's okay to give up after you've been tested and you've seen the reality of a path, but never before (especially if it's part of your aspiration). 

That said, it's also okay to objectively look at an opportunity to learn and decide not to follow through with it because there are more important things for you to be learning right now. In this case, I think that this analysis is very valid. My main area of focus is not game development and I have A LOT more things to learn in order to perform well in my desired career path. Maybe I will realize later that testing my skills in this game is a good milestone in my career, but I don't think that it will be helpful to me right now. I think that it will only delay me from learning other skills that are as important (if not more) as knowing how to code in Python. Plus, I don't even wanna game dev on Python, so why go through all this stress at all? I could have saved myself a lot of time and sanity by being honest with myself and asking, even if aloud, "is this worth for me now?" I would have come to the conclusion: "no, maybe later, but not right now," and I wouldn't even need this reflection. 

It's okay to not want to challenge yourself in something if you don't see value in it. It's okay for you to decide that some career path is not for you, and then "give up" so you can try something new. It's okay for you to try to learn something or to test your skills and fail. That will teach you how to become stronger and will improve your skills. It is not okay for you to mindlessly flame yourself, diminish your self-worth, tell yourself that you can't and won't be able to achieve things, avoid tests/exams so you can avoid "tilt" or feeling inferior due to failure, or keep yourself out of an opportunity to test your knowledge/strength.


Conclusion:
In a nutshell, it's okay for you to feel astray about something. Those negative feelings and thoughts are part of the journey. Just take a little bit of time to reflect on them in the moment. The smallest reflection can tame the biggest of dreads and turn them into work fuel. In other words, become aware of the feeling if you feel like it's buried, so you can face it, understand it, and constructively turn it into growth.
